# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project is to build a simple game of rock, paper, scissors where the player inputs their choice using a prompt, a computer randomly chooses one and each round gives a winner. There a total of five rounds and after this a result is given. This project used JavaScript and used simple concepts such as if/else statements, for loops and switch statements.

Will come back to this project at a later stage to add a GUI to it.
