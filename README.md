# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project is to build a simple game of rock, paper, scissors where the player inputs their choice using a prompt, a computer randomly chooses one and each round gives a winner. There a total of five rounds and after this a result is given. This project used JavaScript and used simple concepts such as if/else statements, for loops and switch statements.

Also added a GUI to this project, which involved using event handlers to wait for a user to choose their move. Then the game would play and alter the text in an existing div to display the score.
